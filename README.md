- 👋 Hi, I’m @ldietrichson
- 👀 I’m interested in development and learning more about coding. I'm also interested in getting to know developers that are currently living in Sweden who I can sparr with. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to navigate myself in Git since I don't have any formal education in coding whatsoever. 
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collarborate! 
- 📫 You reach me through my email: linnea.dietrichson@enfogroup.com
